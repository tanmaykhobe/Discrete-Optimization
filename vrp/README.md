The Capicitated Vehicle Routing Problem has been solved by two methods, depending upon the size of the input.
For smaller inputs and where optimality is desired, the Clarke-Wright heuristic algorithm is used which aims to find a good initial solution by combining routes of individual vehicles to minimize the total distance traveled.
Another approach used for input of larger size is exchanging customers between vehicles if the capacity constraint is not violated and optimizing path for each vehicle so that cost of tour is minimal. 
Both of the above mentioned heuristic approaches give a good optimization but are not guaranteed to provide the most optimal solution.
