# Set Cover Solver

The `myfun` function in the `solution_using_solver.py` module aims to solve the Set Cover problem using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) with the SCIP solver from the OR-Tools library.

## Function Description

The `myfun` function solves the Set Cover problem by following these steps:

1. Initialization:
   - Parameters:
     - `noItems`: The number of items to be covered.
     - `noSets`: The number of sets available.
     - `sets`: A list of sets with their costs and items.
   - The function initializes an instance of the SCIP solver and sets the time limit for solving the problem.

2. Decision Variables:
   - The function creates a binary decision variable `setStatus` to represent the status of each set (whether it is included in the solution or not).
   - The decision variables are stored in a dictionary `setStatus` as Boolean variables.

3. Objective Function:
   - The objective is to minimize the total cost of including sets in the solution.
   - The function defines the variable `cost` and calculates it as the sum of the cost of each set multiplied by its corresponding `setStatus` variable.
   - The objective of the solver is set to minimize `cost`.

4. Constraints:
   - The only constraint in the problem is that all items should be covered by the selected sets in the solution.
   - The function iterates over each item and checks which sets contain that item.
   - A variable `itemSum` keeps track of the sum of `setStatus` variables for the sets that cover each item.
   - A constraint is added to the solver to ensure that `itemSum` is greater than or equal to 1 for each item.

5. Solve Model:
   - The function calls the solver's `Solve` method to solve the model.
   - The solver searches for the optimal solution that minimizes the cost while satisfying the constraints.

6. Solution Retrieval:
   - After solving the model, the function retrieves the status of each set from the solver's solution.
   - The function creates a list `res` and appends the integer value of the `setStatus` variable for each set to `res`.

7. Return:
   - The function returns the list `res`, which represents the solution to the Set Cover problem. Each element in the list indicates whether the corresponding set is included (1) or not included (0) in the optimal solution.


## Summary

The `myfun` function uses Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) with the SCIP solver to solve the Set Cover problem. It formulates the problem by defining decision variables, an objective function, and constraints. After solving the model, it retrieves the solution indicating which sets should be selected to cover

 all items while minimizing the cost.
