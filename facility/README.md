This code uses the OR-Tools library to solve a facility location problem using the SCIP solver. The goal is to determine which facilities should be opened and which customers should be served by each facility in order to minimize the total cost, which includes setup costs and distances between customers and facilities.

Here is a summary of how the code works:

1. Define the `length` function, which calculates the Euclidean distance between two points using their coordinates.

2. Define the `solver_using_scip` function, which takes two lists as input: `facilities` and `customers`.

3. Set up the SCIP solver and configure the time limit for solving the problem based on the number of facilities.

4. Create decision variables using `BoolVar` for facility status (open/closed) and facility-customer assignments.

5. Define the constraints:
   - Each customer must be served by exactly one facility.
   - The sum of demands of customers served by a facility must be less than or equal to the facility's capacity.
   - A facility can only serve a customer if it is open.

6. Define the objective function:
   - Minimize the sum of setup costs for open facilities.
   - Minimize the sum of distances between customers and their assigned facilities.

7. Call the `solver.Solve()` method to solve the problem.

8. Retrieve the solution:
   - Iterate over the decision variables to determine the facility index that serves each customer.
   - Store the facility indices in the `res` list.

9. Return the `res` list, which represents the facility indices serving each customer.

The code uses the SCIP solver to find an optimal solution to the facility location problem. It formulates the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model with binary decision variables and applies constraints and an objective function to determine the optimal facility assignments.
